Matrix build:
-------------
We are building our software on different distributions with the help of docker images. Right now
we are using versions of Ubuntu, Fedora and Debian.

OSX build:
----------
We are using the OSX support of Travis CI to build EFL on OSX. Build testing two combinations: Xcode
7.3.1 on OS X 10.11 and Xcode 8.3.3 on OS X 10.12.

Run locally:
------------
For easy developer testing the CI setup can also be run in full or only parts locally on the
developers machine. You need to have docker installed and after that it is a simple:

docker pull fedora:26
docker build -f .ci/Dockerfile-Fedora26 .

Travis:
